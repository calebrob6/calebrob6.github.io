excerpt: 'We created a computational framework to determine which roads in Senegal should be fortified against flooding in order to maximize accessibility under a fixed budget. We combined road network data, data about different flooding scenarios, and human mobility data to estimate how accessibility over the road network in Senegal would be affected under different flooding scenarios. We found that optimizing over different accessibility measures give nonuniform improvements to mobility in different parts of the country, and demonstrate the tradeoffs between the available budget for road network repairs and the overall benefit of the repairs.'
