excerpt: 'We propose a simple method for extracting stronger labels from weak cropland labels and an unsupervised segmentation of satellite imagery. We show, in a scenario in Kenya where we only have 33 human-annotated labels, that adding strong labels mined by our method increases the F1 score for the cropland category from
0.53 (without mining) to 0.84.

We propose a simple method for extracting stronger labels from weak cropland labels and an unsupervised segmentation of satellite imagery. We show, in a scenario in Kenya where we only have 33 human-annotated labels, that adding strong labels mined by our method increases the F1 score for the cropland category from
0.53 (without mining) to 0.84.

<b>Figure 1.</b>Overview of the proposed approach. Our study focuses on identifying objects of interest from decades-long aerial photos (1943-1972) to study long-term environmental changes in: (A) the Oshikango region (~5000 km<sup>2</sup>) in the North-Central Namibia; (B) a 45km<sup>2</sup> area in Oshikango region was sparsely annotated and used as train and test region in our framework; (C) representative examples were annotated for the classes: <i>Big Tree</i>, <i>Omuti</i> and <i>Waterhole</i>; (D) a deep learning framework that aims to apply a semantic segmentation on the aerial photos and trained with different strategies; (E) insights are extracted to understand the change between 1943 and 1972.
