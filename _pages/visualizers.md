Interactive visualizations and tools for exploring various concepts in computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.

## Computer Vision & Machine Learning

### [IoU Playground](/static/iou_playground.html)
An interactive tool for exploring Intersection over Union (IoU) calculations. Drag and move polygons to see how IoU metrics change in real-time, helping build intuition for this fundamental object detection metric.

### [Pixel Counting vs. Area Estimation](/static/pixel_counting_playground.html)
Visualize the difference between counting pixels and estimating areas for segmentation tasks. This tool demonstrates how different sampling strategies affect accuracy when measuring object areas in computer vision applications.

### [Receptive Field Playground](/static/receptive_field_playground.html)
Explore the concept of receptive fields and effective receptive fields in convolutional neural networks. Interactively adjust network architectures to understand how different layer configurations affect the receptive field size.

### [Morphology Playground](/static/morphology_playground.html)
Interactive demonstration of morphological operations (erosion, dilation, opening, closing) commonly used in image processing. Draw shapes and apply operations to see their effects in real-time.

### [Monty Hall Explorer](/static/monty_hall_playground.html)
Interactive playground that lets you play and simulate generalized Monty Hall games with N doors, K host openings, and optional uninformed host behavior to see how switching amplifies your odds.


## Utilities

### [Runner's Pace Calculator](/static/pacing.html)
A practical tool for runners to convert between pace, speed, and race times for various distances. Useful for training planning and race strategy.
