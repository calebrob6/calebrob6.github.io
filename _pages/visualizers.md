Interactive visualizations and tools for exploring various concepts in computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.

## Computer Vision & Machine Learning

### [IoU Playground](/static/iou_playground.html)
An interactive tool for exploring Intersection over Union (IoU) calculations. Drag and move polygons to see how IoU metrics change in real-time, helping build intuition for this fundamental object detection metric.

### [Pixel Counting vs. Area Estimation](/static/pixel_counting_playground.html)
Visualize the difference between counting pixels and estimating areas for segmentation tasks. This tool demonstrates how different sampling strategies affect accuracy when measuring object areas in computer vision applications.

### [Receptive Field Playground](/static/receptive_field_playground.html)
Explore the concept of receptive fields and effective receptive fields in convolutional neural networks. Interactively adjust network architectures to understand how different layer configurations affect the receptive field size.

### [Morphology Playground](/static/morphology_playground.html)
Interactive demonstration of morphological operations (erosion, dilation, opening, closing) commonly used in image processing. Draw shapes and apply operations to see their effects in real-time.

### [Polygon Comparison Playground (PoLiS)](/static/polygon_difference_playground.html)
Interactive playground for comparing polygons using the PoLiS metric, useful for evaluating building footprint predictions in remote sensing applications.

### [Image Feature Extraction Demo](/static/feature_design_playground.html)
Explore image feature extraction techniques and filters interactively. Apply various convolution kernels to understand how feature detectors work in computer vision.

### [Grid Artifact FFT Playground](/static/fft_playground.html)
Visualize grid artifacts and analyze them using Fast Fourier Transform. Useful for understanding periodic patterns and artifacts in satellite imagery.

### [Decision Tree Explorer](/static/decision_tree_explorer.html)
Interactive demo for exploring decision tree algorithms using the UCI Adult Income Dataset. Build manual trees or use automated algorithms to understand how decision trees classify data.

### [Random Forest Explorer](/static/random_forest_explorer.html)
Interactive demo showing how random forests improve on single decision trees through ensemble learning. Train hundreds of bootstrapped trees and visualize how majority voting reduces variance and improves accuracy.

### [Precision / Recall / Prevalence @ Scale](/static/precision_at_scale.html)
Explore how precision, recall, and false positive counts behave when deploying models at scale with varying prevalence. Understand why a model that looks great on balanced validation sets can produce many false positives in deployment.

### [Monty Hall Explorer](/static/monty_hall_playground.html)
Interactive playground that lets you play and simulate generalized Monty Hall games with N doors, K host openings, and optional uninformed host behavior to see how switching amplifies your odds.


## Utilities

### [Runner's Pace Calculator](/static/pacing.html)
A practical tool for runners to convert between pace, speed, and race times for various distances. Useful for training planning and race strategy.
