  title={Models of Human Mobility: Migration vs. Commuting},
  author={Robinson, Caleb and Dilkina, Bistra},
  journal={NetSci},
  note={Abstract/Poster.},
  year={2017},
  abstract={Models of human mobility in their different forms are important for many reasons. Models of human commuting can help reduce traffic congestion and pollution and can be used to drive land use policy and actual development choices [1]. Models of human migration are equally important to policy makers and can give broader estimates of how the population of an urban area will change in upcoming years. Much recent research focuses on modeling human commuting flows; however little has focused on modeling human migration. In our work we use a network science based approach to study whether several common models used in commuting applications, including the gravity model [2] and radiation model [3], can be used to effectively model human migration as well (Figure 1). We analyze commuting and migration networks in the USA and find that the dynamics of these two forms of human mobility are different and therefore require different models. Finally, we identify models that better predict human migration dynamics and compare their accuracies to those of the gravity and radiation models.},
